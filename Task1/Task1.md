To debugg a web application to investigate an issue where a form submission fails we can use browser's developer tools to identify the problem.
Whenever a form submission fails, let's take the payment form submission example provide for the task .Once the details are entered by user on clicking submit button it shows error "Server validation failed"

    1.To debug a web form is to check the HTML code of the form element and its inputs. Make sure that the form has a valid action attribute, which specifies the URL where the data will be sent. Also, ensure that each input has a name attribute, which identifies the data field. If the form or the inputs are missing these attributes, the data will not be submitted correctly.

    2.Check the JavaScript code that handles the form submission. Sometimes, the JavaScript code may prevent the default behavior of the form, such as using the event.preventDefault() method, or may have errors or bugs that interfere with the data transmission.
    We can use the browser's developer tools to inspect the HTML code and look for errors or warnings.

    3.The network may be slow or unreliable, or the server may be down or busy, causing the form submission to fail or timeout.We can use the browser's network tab to monitor the network requests and responses  to inspect the network request that is triggered when the form is submitted. Verify that the request is being sent to the correct endpoint and that the request payload is formatted correctly.
    we can head over to the browser developer tools either by right click and select inspect then go to source tab  or F12 will direct to network tab from there select source tab.
    a.In  the source tab we can see the files in the program.
        here we can see Watch where we can add and see the watch expressions, then breakpoints to see the code of the line  add a breakpoint to .
        A breakpoint is like a line marker we can set in the developer tools to pause the execution of your code before that line executes, then scope contains the local and global variables.
        Callstack: shows the function calls that lead to the current point of code execution
        1.From the listed out file we can select any file  ,then we can use the debugger tab.
        2.To start debugging the code, you can add a breakpoint to a line by clicking the line number.
        This lets you check variable values, see if functions are called as expected, or observe the general flow of the code.
        When we add a breakpoint and execute the code, a bluish icon appears on that line, indicating that execution will pause before that line.
    b.Select Network tab refresh the page
    c.We can see list of http queries select the request we want to debugg
    d. In the Headers tab we can see the request info ,the status code ,request method ,request URl and all details.



    4.look for status codes and headers.
    HTTP status codes  are
    Informational responses (100 – 199)
    Successful responses (200 – 299)
    Redirection messages (300 – 399)
    Client error responses (400 – 499)
    Server error responses (500 – 599)

    In this Example payment form to debug issue go to the developer tools and click on submit utton after entering inputs in the fields select the network tab  we can see the name the validate-payment with error cross icon .
    In the Headers tab  we can see Status Code:
    405 Method Not AllowedThe means HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed error status code indicates that a server received a request using an HTTP method that the requested resource doesn't support:
    If we're trying to submit a form or make an API request using a method that the server doesn’t support for the given endpoint, that's why we see a 405 error.
    If we're working with an API, check its documentation to ensure you're using the correct HTTP method for the endpoint you're calling.
    To make a request (eg: an AJAX or Fetch request) from one origin to another (cross-origin request), the server might reject the request with a 405 if it doesn't allow the HTTP method for the origin making the request.
    making a POST request to /validate-payment, ensure that the server isn't properly handling that route and the POST method.


    5.Checking the validation rules.
    Validation errors can prevent form submission.Incorrect data formats or missing required fields blocks form submission. Checking for validation errors either through browser console logs or server-side error messages was crucial for resolving these issues.

    6.check the database connection and operations for the form data. Sometimes, the database may be inaccessible or incompatible, causing the data to be lost or corrupted, or to violate the database schema or constraints. Using the server-side language and framework such as PHP, Node.js, to connect to the database and perform queries and transactions.
